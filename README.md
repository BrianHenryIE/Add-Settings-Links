# Add-Settings-Links

A wordpress plugin which adds direct links to the plugins admin page for plugins that do not have direct links to their settings panel listed on the plugins page

**Partially Working Functionality**

Plugins that create top level menu items on the sidebar, and submenu items under "settings".

--------------------------------

**Known bugs** 

For plugins that create submenu items under tools or users or unconventional locations (lets say appearances for example) it does not correctly identify the url.
