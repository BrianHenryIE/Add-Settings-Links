# Add-Settings-Links

A wordpress plugin which adds direct links to the plugins admin page for plugins that do not have direct links to their settings panel listed on the plugins page

**Partially Working Functionality**

Plugins that create top level menu items on the sidebar, and submenu items under "settings" have the correct settings page urls added to plugins.php.

--------------------------------

Edit: **I believe the issue mentioned below should be fixed in v2, please let me know in an issue if you're having problems, and I will try to implement a fix!**

**Known bugs** 

For plugins that create submenu items under tools or users or unconventional locations (lets say appearances for example) it does not correctly identify the url.
